# Photography Portfolio Website

- Created a personal photography portfolio website as my first web development project.
- The site features an About Me section, a slideshow showcasing selected photos, a gallery of images, and a contact form for booking appointments.
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website highlights my photography work while providing an intuitive user experience for potential clients.
